      <h4>What we have in mind for our Grumble community:</h4>
      <p>Self-expression: Grumble is the place for you to express yourself.  Sharing your thoughts and opinions helps you release your frustrations and elevate your mood.</p>
      <p>Supporting each other:  Grumble strives to create a safe and supportive place where people, through shared feelings and experiences, help each other navigate through sometimes rough waters.  Your expression generates energy that may inspire others embarking on their own journey of self-discovery and happiness.</p>
      <p>Enrichment:  We want every experience on Grumble to add value to your life – be it gaining a new perspective, discovering a passion, influencing people for social change, satisfaction through helping others or refining the art of articulating your opinions or ideas. We want Grumble to be a place for you to grow.</p>
      <p>Fun:  Explore, exchange views, reflect and meet new people. Importantly we want you to have lots of fun and laughter – this is a great way to relieve stress and help make your worries fly away.  Humour and playful communication brings people together, helps overcome challenges and inspires hope.  Seek out the numerous uplifting people that have found a place on Grumble or explore the lighter emotions for a powerful and instant boost.</p>
      <p>Privacy:  Grumble respects the importance of social gatherings that take place away from the prying eyes of those that you may know.   We believe that you should have control over how you interact with our community.  You may choose to expand your horizons, sharing emotions or experimenting with different personalities, with interesting people from all around the world.  If you are after something more familiar then inviting your friends from your personal life or connections from other social networks may be the way to go.  An even more intimate experience is also achievable for those that would rather surround themselves with trusted listeners or simply use the app as a journal.</p>

      <h4><strong>Why we have Grumble Guidelines:</strong></h4>
      <p>While Grumble encourages you to freely express who you really are, we also strive to foster a positive and supportive community that values the wellbeing of all our users.</p>
      <p>These guidelines establish the boundaries for the content and behaviours that we expect – to avoid any confusion:</p>

      <h4><strong>Respect the Grumble community</strong></h4>
      <p>Grumble is a place where different people from all over the globe can come to share emotions and the most personal of moments so we are unwavering in our determination to foster a respectful and understanding community.  In order to preserve people’s safety and promote respect, Grumble may delete your content or accounts without prior notice if you harass, threaten, stalk or attempt to humiliate or publicly shame others or use hate language.</p>
      <p>Grumble asks our community to exist harmoniously and embrace the richness of diversity.  Users must not post offensive content against any ethnicity, race, gender identity, sexual orientation or religion.</p>
      <p><strong>Self-harm is an important issue that should not be glorified</strong></p>
      <p>We want to raise awareness of issues affecting people as we believe this can be a helpful way of coping and getting through a difficult period.  Having said this, if you know someone who may have thoughts of self-harm or is going through a tough time, then there are services that can help:</p>
